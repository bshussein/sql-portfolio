# Database Design

This folder contains database schemas and ER models that I created in MySQL Workbench.

Highlights:
- `membership_schema_and_indexes.sql` – table design, indexes, and constraints for a membership database
- `eer*_forward_engineering.sql` – forward-engineered scripts from three ER models
- `eer1_erd.png` – exported ER diagram image

These artifacts show how I design and implement relational schemas, normalize tables, and enforce relationships with foreign keys.
