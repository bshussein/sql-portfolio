# SQL Analysis Projects

This folder contains end-to-end SQL analysis projects built using real, public
datasets. Each project follows a complete analytical workflow rather than
isolated query examples.

Across these projects, SQL is used to:
- Clean and validate raw data
- Handle missing or inconsistent values
- Perform exploratory analysis and aggregation
- Compare trends across time, geography, and categories

Each project includes:
- A project-specific README describing the dataset and goals
- SQL scripts for data cleaning and analysis
- The original dataset or a reference to its public source

These projects are intended to reflect how SQL is used in real data analyst work,
from raw data to insight.
