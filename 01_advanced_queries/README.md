# Advanced Queries

This folder contains analytical SQL queries written against the AP sample database.

- `joins_and_unions.sql` – multi-table queries using JOINs (and UNION where applicable)
- `grouping_and_summarizing.sql` – GROUP BY queries and aggregate summaries
- `subqueries.sql` – examples of using subqueries instead of joins and for filtering

Each file includes comments and exercise labels from my coursework.
