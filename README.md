# SQL Portfolio

This portfolio contains selected SQL work from my university database course and a small application that uses SQL in a real program. I did not upload every exercise; instead I curated the work that best reflects skills used in real data analysis and backend development.

The portfolio includes:

- **01_advanced_queries** – joins, grouping, and subqueries on a realistic AP database
- **02_database_design** – database schemas and ER models created in MySQL Workbench
- **03_data_modification** – insert, update, and delete operations with business logic
- **04_student_course_scheduler** – a Python + MySQL mini-project for managing students, courses, and schedules

This repo will grow over time as I add more personal SQL projects.
