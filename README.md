# SQL Portfolio

This repository showcases my SQL work through **applied data analysis projects**
and **core SQL patterns used in business and analytics contexts**.

The focus is on using SQL to clean, validate, and analyze data in ways that
support real analytical questions.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into two main sections, each serving a different
purpose in demonstrating my SQL skills.

### Projects/
Contains end-to-end SQL analysis projects using real, public datasets.  
These focus on the full analytical workflow: data cleaning, validation,
exploration, and drawing insights from imperfect data.

This section reflects how SQL is used in real analyst work.

### sql_business_analysis/
Contains curated SQL examples that demonstrate core query patterns and database
concepts commonly used in business and analytics roles.  
The folders are numbered to show skill progression, covering areas such as
aggregation, joins, schema design, and data modification in realistic business
scenarios.

Together, these sections show both foundational SQL knowledge and its practical
application.
