# SQL Portfolio

This repository showcases curated SQL work that reflects both **foundational database
skills** and **applied, end-to-end data analysis projects**.

The structure of the repository is intentional:
- **Projects/** contains complete SQL case studies using real datasets
- **sql_coursework/** contains numbered folders that represent a progression of
  SQL concepts and backend-oriented skills

I did not upload every assignment or exercise. Instead, I selected work that best
demonstrates how I use SQL for data analysis, data quality checks, and integration
with real programs.

## Applied SQL Projects (End-to-End Case Studies)

These projects follow a full data workflow:
**raw data → cleaning → validation → analysis → documented insights**

### World Life Expectancy Analysis
Analyzes global life expectancy trends across countries and years, with a focus on
data quality, time-based analysis, and relationships between health and economic
indicators.

**Highlights:**
- Cleaning inconsistent and missing values
- Time-series aggregation and trend analysis
- Validation checks for data integrity

📁 `Projects/world-life-expectancy`

---

### US Household Income Analysis
Explores household income patterns across U.S. states, cities, and household types
by joining geographic data with income statistics.

**Highlights:**
- Standardizing categorical data
- Working with multiple related tables
- Geographic and demographic comparisons

📁 `Projects/us-household-income`

## SQL Coursework (Numbered Skill Progression)

This section contains focused SQL work from my university database course.
The folders are **numbered to reflect conceptual progression**, from query fundamentals
to schema design and application-level integration.

### 01 — Advanced Queries
Practice with joins, grouping, unions, and subqueries on a realistic dataset.

📁 `sql_coursework/01_advanced_queries`

---

### 02 — Database Design
Relational schema design and ER modeling using MySQL Workbench, including forward
engineering and constraint enforcement.

📁 `sql_coursework/02_database_design`

---

### 03 — Data Modification
Insert, update, and delete operations implemented with business logic and data
integrity considerations.

📁 `sql_coursework/03_data_modification`

---

### 04 — Student Course Scheduler (Python + MySQL)
A small backend-oriented application demonstrating how SQL integrates with a real
program to manage students, courses, and enrollments.

📁 `sql_coursework/04_student_course_scheduler`

## Notes
- SQL dialect: MySQL
- Public datasets are included in project folders where appropriate
- Projects emphasize data quality, reproducibility, and analytical reasoning

This repository will continue to evolve as I add more applied SQL projects.
